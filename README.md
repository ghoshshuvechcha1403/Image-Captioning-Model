<h1>📸 Image Caption Generator</h1>

<p>
    This project represents a sophisticated fusion of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, culminating in an effective Image Caption Generator.
    The core of the system is a classic <b>Encoder-Decoder architecture</b> built using <b>TensorFlow/Keras</b>. The <b>VGG16 CNN</b> acts as the Encoder, extracting high-dimensional visual features, which are then fed to an <b>LSTM network</b> (the Decoder) to generate descriptive sentences.
    Crucially, the model incorporates an <b>Attention Mechanism</b> to ensure the captioning process dynamically focuses on the most relevant parts of the image as each word is generated, leading to more accurate and contextually rich descriptions.
</p>
<p>
    The deployment script leverages <b>Streamlit</b> for a clean, user-friendly interface. While the core training uses your custom CNN-LSTM model, the final web application is enhanced by integrating the modern <b>Salesforce BLIP model</b> (via Hugging Face Transformers) for state-of-the-art inference speed and quality, showcasing a robust, full-stack machine learning solution.

<h2>💾 Data Preprocessing Steps</h2>
<p>This section details the critical steps taken to transform the raw text and image data into a format suitable for the neural network:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Caption Normalization</b>: Details how raw text is treated (lowercased, punctuation removed, single characters filtered) to create a clean, standardized vocabulary.</li>
    <li><b>Start/End Tokenization</b>: Explains the addition of <code>startseq</code> and <code>endseq</code> tokens, which are essential markers for the LSTM decoder to know when to begin and terminate sentence generation.</li>
    <li><b>Vocabulary and Padding</b>: Specifies that a consistent vocabulary is built and all input sequences are padded to a single maximum length, a requirement for batch processing in the Keras model.</li>
    <li><b>Feature Persistence</b>: Highlights that VGG16 features are pre-extracted and saved (using <code>pickle</code>) to disk, eliminating the need to re-run the time-consuming extraction process for every training session.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📈 Model Performance & Metrics</h2>
<p>This section follows the Inference and Evaluation part and provides a deeper breakdown of your model's performance on the test set:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Greedy Search Decoding</b>: Explicitly states that the current inference mechanism uses Greedy Search, where the model selects the single word with the highest probability at each step to build the caption.</li>
    <li><b>BLEU Score Breakdown</b>: Provides the final, trained BLEU scores (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, etc.) and explains what each score represents (e.g., BLEU-1 measures unigram matching, BLEU-2 measures bigram matching).</li>
    <li><b>Validation Loss Tracking</b>: Mentions that the model tracks validation loss during the 50 epochs to ensure training generalizes well and does not overfit to the training data.</li>
</ul>
